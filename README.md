# Better Comment

Simply chooses to toggle a line comment or a block comment depending on where the start of the selection is. If the selection does not begin at the start of a line then a block comment is toggled, otherwise a line comment is toggled. If there is no current selection, it will try to detect a block comment under the cursor and toggle it, otherwise it will toggle a line comment.

By default, it overrides the standard line comment toggle key definition, `Ctrl+/` or `Cmd+/`, which is assigned to **bettercomment.toggle**.

Lastly, if a multi-line selection is commented in a file which doesn't support line comments (see configuration), the selection will be commented with a block comment on each line. Override the configuration to an empty array to disable this behaviour.
